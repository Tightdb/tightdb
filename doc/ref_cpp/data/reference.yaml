STATUS:
  CODE    : Beta
  DESCR   : All the features of Realm are fully functional and tested and used
            by some companies in production.
            It is however to be considered beta software, and changes to the API
            based on user feedback should still be expected.
            The latest feature "Asynchroneous" durability in SharedGroup, should
            still be considered "experimental", due to the limited exposure to
            customer usage for such a new feature.

            The goal of Realm is to provide high performance
            data storage for your applications.

            Realm integrates seamless in your programming language, making it
            fast to learn and easy to use.  You can replace your traditional data
            structures with Realm. Whether it is a simple array of integers or a
            complex structure, you interface to Realm as easily as using a
            standard array or vector like container. But in addition you can
            handle much more data in much less space, you get powerful query
            possibilities in an intuitive language and the ability to share your data
            across all supported languages and platforms.

            The core of the framework are the classes {@link class_typed_table} and
            {@link class_dyn_table}. Both classes are a representation of the
            fundamental <strong>Table</strong> concept. {@link class_typed_table}
            is used if you know the table structure a priori while {@link class_dyn_table}
            provides the flexibility for situation where the data model changes
            dynamically or is only known at runtime.

            Tables organize data in columns and rows and data is compacted for
            low memory usage. The interface to the data resembles the native
            data structures. Moreover, tables can have tables as data. Using subtables
            you can build complex data structures.

            It is possible to query data using the {@link class_typed_query} and
            {@link class_dyn_query} classes. Queries can be complex - involving
            any columns and values. You can either apply aggregate functions to your
            resulting data set or use the data set in your application as a
            {@link class_dyn_tableview} or {@link class_typed_tableview} object.

            The {@link class_group} class lets you serialize tables to disk or memory. The
            Realm data format is consistent across operating systems, hardware platforms,
            and programming languages. This implies that you can share data across applications
            and environments.

            For multi-threaded or multi-process applications, you can use the {@link class_shared_group}.
            As the {@link class_group} class, the {@link class_shared_group} lets you serialize
            your tables to disk. Moreover, the {@link class_shared_group} class provides a transaction
            interface to your group.
