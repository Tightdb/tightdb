SUMMARY     : &g_group_summary
              Container for tables.
DESCR       :
- TEXT      : &g_group_descr
              >
              The Group is a container for tables. The group can be attached
              to three different forms of storage: (1) internal, (2) a user
              provided buffer or (3) a file on disk.

              When a group is attached to a buffer in memory (2), changes to tables
              in the group does not cause changes to the buffer. Regardless, the
              buffer must remain allocated as long as the group exist. A parameter
              controls whether the group assumes responsibility for deallocation or
              not.

              When a group is attached to a writable file (3), changes to tables in the group
              are kept buffered until commit() is called. The call to commit
              will update the file.

              When a group is attached to a read-only file (3), changes to tables in the group
              cannot be committed to the file, but the entire group can be serialized to
              (another) file.

              A group can be serialized into a memory buffer or a file in
              Realm's highly efficient binary format, or it can be serialized
              to a stream in either ascii or json format.

              The result of serializing in Realm's own binary format (whether as a file
              or a memory buffer) can later be attached to a group. This makes it easy
              to exchange data between applications written in any supported programming language.

              A group can hold one or more tables. If a table is going to be
              serialized, you must create the table using the group. It is not
              possible to dynamically add a table to a group.

              Accessing a Realm database file through manual
              construction of a Group object does not offer any
              level of thread safety or transaction safety. When
              any of those kinds of safety are a concern, consider
              using a SharedGroup instead. When accessing a
              database file in read/write mode through a manually
              constructed Group object, it is entirely the
              responsibility of the application that the file is
              not accessed in any way by a third party during the
              life-time of that group object. It is, on the other
              hand, safe to concurrently access a database file by
              multiple manually created Group objects, as long as
              all of them are opened in read-only mode, and there
              is no other party that modifies the file
              concurrently.

                 Group objects can be created in various ways
                 depending on use pattern.

                 You can either just create a new (empty) group (1), or load an
                 existing group either from a file (2) or a memory buffer (3).

                 A group may also be constructed in an unattached
                 state (4). See open() and is_attached() for more on
                 this.

                 If <tt>take_ownership</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, you will
                 pass the ownership of the specified buffer to the
                 Group instance. In this case the buffer will
                 eventually be freed using std::free(), so the buffer
                 you pass, must have been allocated using
                 std::malloc().

                 On the other hand, if <tt>take_ownership</tt> is set

                 the memory buffer alive during the lifetime of the
                 group, and in case the buffer needs to be deallocated
                 afterwards, that is your responsibility too.

                 If an exception is signalled, the caller retains ownership
                 and must free the buffer, even if <tt>take_ownership</tt> was true.

                 Attach this Group instance to a file or an externally
                 supplied memory buffer.

                 By default, the specified file is opened in read-only
                 mode (mode_ReadOnly). This allows opening a file even
                 when the caller lacks permission to write to that
                 file. The opened group may still be modified freely,
                 but the changes cannot be written back to the same
                 file using the commit() function. An attempt to do
                 that, will cause an exception to be thrown. When
                 opening in read-only mode, it is an error if the
                 specified file does not already exist in the file
                 system.

                 Alternatively, the file can be opened in read/write
                 mode (mode_ReadWrite). This allows use of the
                 commit() function, but, of course, it also requires
                 that the caller has permission to write to the
                 specified file. When opening in read-write mode, an
                 attempt to create the specified file will be made, if
                 it does not already exist in the file system.

                 In any case, if the file already exists, it must
                 contain a valid Realm database. In many cases
                 invalidity will be detected and cause the
                 InvalidDatabase exception to be thrown, but you
                 should not rely on it.

                 A file that is passed to Group::open(), may not be
                 modified by a third party until after the Group
                 object is destroyed. Behavior is undefined if a file
                 is modified by a third party while any Group object
                 is associated with it.

                 Calling open() on a Group instance that is already in
                 the attached state has undefined behavior.

                 Specifying a memory buffer is equivalent to
                 specifying a file except that (a) in this case the
                 database is assumed to be stored in that buffer instead
                 of a file and (b) it is not possible to use commit or in
                 other ways change the buffer. If you change the contents
                 of the group and want to persist your changes you must
                 use one of the functions for serialization.

                 Write this group of tables to a new file.
      DESCR    : &g_group_write_to_file_descr
                 This method will write the group to persistent storage (disk). Metadata and tables
                 will be stored, and can be retrieved at later times.

                 It is an error to specify a file that already exists.
                 This is to protect against overwriting a database file
                 that is currently open, which would cause undefined
                 behaviour.
