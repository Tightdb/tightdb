********************************************************************************************************
Create ArrayFloat::find() and ArrayDouble::find() that utilize SSE and then create a specialized Node
template <class Equal, class TConditionFunction> class FloatDoubleNode: public ParentNode
to integrate it into query system


Idea
********************************************************************************************************
Move ParentNode::aggregate() to some place outside nodes (maybe into query.cpp?). Because it's confusing design that all nodes have this method and that you can call it on any of them. Scheduling/performance, etc, is exactly the same regardless of which is called. It was just sloppy development.

Idea
********************************************************************************************************
Note: All nodes contain a list of all nodes the vector<ParentNode*>m_children vector (so that they can call methods on eachother). Pointer to self is also stored, always in entry 0. The m_children lists are populated in the init() methods from the m_child pointers of all nodes in the node chain that query.cpp costructs when the user calls condition methods:

IntegerNode		  +---------> StringNode      +--------> ORNode             +-------> IntegerNode
m_child -----------           m_child ---------          m_child = ----------         m_child = NULL
                                                         m_cond[2]
														 ||
                                                         sub node chains

The population of m_children happens through a gather_children() method call from init().

All these m_children vectors could maybe be gathered into a single vector stored somewhere else. However, note that sub node chains of ORNodes would need their own. So a single global is not enough. More analyzing is needed.
														 
Idea
********************************************************************************************************												 
The methods of QueryState (which consumes matches) are templated by Action (find, findall, count, etc):

    template <Action action, bool pattern> inline bool match(...)

I think it could be a simplification (I'm not sure though) to template the QueryState class instead.
	
Also, many methods of Node classes are templated. It *could* be a simplification to template the classes instead. For example

    template<Action TAction, class TResult, class TSourceColumn> TResult aggregate(...)

This would be a bit more complex task than QueryState. So begin with QueryState.

query_engine: Optimize cost() method and/or m_dD and m_dT constants for the different node classes. Do not trust that any existing values or formulas are near optimal at all, because I have only done very little measurements, and
mostly just guessing.
