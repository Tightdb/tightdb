String and binary data sizes:
-----------------------------

TightDB currently has the following limitations:

- The maximum size of a table and column mames is 63 bytes. Note that
  this applies to the UTF-8 encoding of the name, so the maximum
  number of characters is less in general.

- The maximum size of a string stored in a string column is 16383
  bytes. Note that this applies to the UTF-8 encoding of the string,
  so the maximum number of characters is less in general.

- The maximum size of a binary data object stored in a binary data
  column is 16384 bytes.



Strings and Unicode:
--------------------

TightDB has full support for Unicode. Internally it stores all strings
using the UTF-8 character encoding.

Although it is not fully implemented yet, it is the intention that when
TightDB performs case insensitive string comparisons, it uses the
locale indenpendant case folding mechanism as described in “Caseless
Matching,” in Section 5.18, Case Mappings of the the Unicode Standard.



Date/time:
----------

TightDB supports only one date/time data type called 'Date'. A Date
value represents an absolute point it time, and is represented as an
integral non-negative number of seconds since midnight (UTC), 1
January 1970, not counting leap seconds.

Please note that it is not currently possible to store a date that
preceeds the year 1970. We are working on an improved date/time
representation that does not have this limitation.



Misc.:
------

Due to memory mapping, read/write errors are not reported by the
library in the usual way. On Linux an application will have to install
signal handlers to cach such errors. The only exception to this rule
is Group::write(), which will report write errors by throwing an
exception.
