# ThreadSanitizer suppressions file for realm-core

# `AESCryptor::read()` and`copy_up_to_date_page()` copy entire pages.
# They may overwrite something which
# is being read concurrently. The reason it is benign, is that whenever there is a
# race, it overwrites with the same value as is already there, so the reader sees
# the correct value. This is all by design.
